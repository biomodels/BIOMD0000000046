**Notes of the BioModels curators:**

The current model reproduce the figure 7, panel B of the paper. Note that
there is a typo in the figure. The ordinates represent the concentration of
peroxyde, as stated in the legend, and not of oxygen. The model has been
tested in COPASI (http://www.copasi.org/, build 13).
